## Motor sport Cloud Data Platform - Azure Databricks

###### I built a comprehensive Formula 1 data project leveraging Azure Databricks and Spark Core, utilizing data sourced from the Ergast API. The project involved several key components and tasks:

#### Infrastructure Setup:

* Developed notebooks and dashboards in Azure Databricks to facilitate data analysis and visualization.
* Configured and managed clusters, cluster pools, and jobs to optimize computational resources and improve processing efficiency.

#### Data Ingestion and Transformation:

* Utilized PySpark in Azure Databricks to ingest and transform raw data from the Ergast API.
* Applied various data cleaning and transformation techniques to ensure data quality and consistency.

#### Data Analysis:

* Employed Spark SQL within Azure Databricks to perform in-depth data analysis.
* Generated insights and performed complex queries to analyze the performance and statistics of Formula 1 races.

#### Lakehouse Architecture Implementation:

* Implemented a Lakehouse architecture using Delta Lake, combining the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses to ensure robust data storage and management.

#### Automation and Scheduling:

* Created Azure Data Factory pipelines to automate the execution of Databricks notebooks, ensuring streamlined data processing workflows.
* Set up Azure Data Factory triggers to schedule these pipelines, enabling automated data processing and monitoring.

#### Reporting and Visualization:

* Connected PowerBI to Azure Databricks, enabling the creation of interactive and insightful reports and dashboards for data visualization.

#### Data Governance:

* Implemented a data governance solution using Unity Catalog within the Databricks workspace, ensuring secure and compliant data management practices.

This project demonstrates the integration of various Azure services and big data technologies to build a scalable and efficient data processing and analytics solution for real-world Formula 1 data.
